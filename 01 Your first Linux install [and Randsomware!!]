why you should encrypt
- truly protect your data
- your cookies and other passwords
- your banking information
- anything you save
- jailbait
- illegal programs
- the list goes on



Hello all.  i'm re-installing Linux today, and documenting the process a bit
welcome.  Ok, so we’re cheating here a bit as we’re starting from Linux
But later I’ll also show how it’s possible to install a USB from mac or windows as well

So in addition to setting up Linux we’ll be setting up a few useful perks
Probably the main one i’m recommending is the LUKS “encryption”
Disk encryption protects your data.  Only share your key with people you trust
You can see I have an encrypted drive here.  A bit different since it’s external, but same idea

What I’m recommending you have for this video is..
either a laptop or a system you’re ready to reinstall on
Or a desktop with multiple hard drives.  You can experiment and keep your old OS

so dont rush into installing it on all your devices
but do poke around, experiment, see if you can get cool stuff working
see if you can get your 5.1 surround sound driver working
see if your video card is supported or your favorite video games
Linux is a great environment, can be a real paradigm changer for the uninitiated

---------------------------
Some of the other things we’ll touch on:

- the terminal and "synaptic" package manager
- apt and the basics of installing and updating Ubuntu/debian
- backing up and re-installing
- hosting a network drive
- adding users/groups, customizing things and convenience factors
- dual and triple booting
- INSTALLING onto a USB stick (a full OS, not an installation or preview)
- recovery mode (fixing bricked systems)
- encrypting media or external drives
- remote decryption with Dropbear
- logging in remotely.  to "headless" units
- audio and video drivers
- installing fortnite  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBdvza_u2Aw>
---------------------------

Obviously won’t have time to show you all these things
But just want to show that they can be done

So for the installation there's really nothing special about it
The one thing, the golden rule I recommend is: taking all other hard drives out
everything but the main drive.  any OSes or media drives? out!
infected ransomware? out!
