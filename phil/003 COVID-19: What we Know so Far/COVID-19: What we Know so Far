an often forgotten outbreak afflicting the Silent generation.  nonetheless a hugely significant event, leaving 20-50 million dead.

evolved out of the trenches of WWI, this was a virus which targeted and struck down the young.  it used the immune system of healthy people in their prime against them.

the 1918 Stanley Cup finals were called off as both teams became afflicted.  twas the end of october.  and less than 6 days later, hockey's toughest defensiveman was dead; a fever of 107 and lungs completely full of mucous.

among historical events only the black plague compares in severity to the virulent 1918 flu, and modern history nothing like it has been observed since.  Upwards of 50 million working age people perished in mere months.
    [a more virulent strain has not been recorded in previous history, and has not been observed since.]
just as quickly as it appeared, it vanished.  A potent virus, encircling 90% of the globe, leaving its mark on our DNA, carrying its antibodies is now a part of being human.

[may we all learn lessons from history.  no other epidemic compares.]
