<p><s>It was a sunny Spring day of 1907 in bustling downtown New York. All the sweats and labors of noonday genius came together into one great moment, which would never leave the world the same again. Men patted themselves on the back and left the office early, others—filled with enthusiasm—stayed the night. The first commercial plastic "Bakelite" was born, and dozens of commercial applications were immediately realized. Within a year being mass produced (and with the invention of cellophane wrap soon to follow), there was no stopping this incredible plastic bandwagon.</s></p>

<p><s>Fast-forward 110 years and plastic is just a part of "us". No aspect of life, no corner of Earth has escaped unscathed from its presence or besiegement. Plastic is part of our land, our seas, and—though great CO2 emissions—now our air too. In cities it is fast replacing dirt as the primary constituent of household dust. In the past decade, micro-plastics have been observed polluting the marine food chain and our bodies with it. Scientists don't believe this poses an immediate health risk, but it could certainly be a canary in the coal mine.</s></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enough plastics are disposed of each year to encircle the Earth four times. Each year the oceans alone absorb three full garbage bags for every meter of shoreline. By 2050, there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish. Yet we are complacent, we have no sense of urgency. No one questions it, no one blames us, we go about our daily life unprovoked. We drive past a landfill and the smell of it—though a thorn in our side—we so naturally ignore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many sea lions—tangled together amidst a mess of commercial fishing line—must gasp in obscurity, how many Albatross will starve with stomachs full of plastic, how much more fertile land needs to be devoted to toxic landfill waste, how many more candy-bar wrappers tossed carelessly to the wind, and how many more shellfish dissolved in acidic ocean conditions before society takes a collective stand and reaches a tipping point? How much attention needs to be drawn to these decades-old issues before they're finally faced and the unsung heroes of these tragedies are finally paid tribute?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individuals can try to go plastic-free, but it is impossible today. They may succeed themselves, only to struggle with influencing the culture at large.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a World Health Organization. What we really need now is a World Environment Organization.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><s>We should address the problem at the source. Cleaning plastic out of the Ocean is reactive, so is waiting for it to decay in landfills. We must be proactive. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.</s></p>

<h2>Micro-Litter: The High Price of Cheap Clothes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most clothing and apparel today is made with at least 10% "polyester"—a plastic fiber which each time it is washed, sheds more and more micro-fibers into the wastewater, until it finally wears out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work is being done to filter these out of the washing machine prior to discharge, but this is <em>not</em> a cure. The same polyester shirt sheds fibers in dryers, which expel the vented air into the outdoor environment. The same shirt sheds fibers just being worn about and moved around. It is a microscopic pollution factory, silently shedding itself on your shoulders as you walk. We are all guilty of <em>daily</em> littering on a micro-scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disentwining any deeply ingrained social issue is never easy. The true solution likely involves a return to basics, of raising cotton production and lowering our reproductive rate so that we can afford to clothe people naturally, without cheap polyester alternatives. While it is nice to discuss these things, the sad truth is they may never become a reality in the current political climate. The use of cheap clothing is only expected to rise, especially as the urban African and South American populations continue to rise in the coming decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the polymers can be made more resilient to breakage—so shedding becomes minimal in clothing. As for recycling mixed fabrics (cotton and polyester), recovery programs can be put in place to extract the synthetic fibers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless, it seems inescapable that cheap, synthetic clothes should only be produced when desperately needed (e.g. medical gowns during a pandemic). They are not sustainable at their current rate.s</p>

<h2>Greenhouse Emissions and Ocean "Acidification"</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite popular belief, the amount of CO2 released in annual plastic production dwarfs automobile and transportation-related emissions. Industrial and commercial CO2 releases—along with methane from herding cattle—account for the main two sources of global warming. In terms of ocean acidification (which could be an equally imminent issue) methane is not a factor, and industrial CO2 is the main culprit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The single easiest solution for addressing both landfill waste and CO2 emissions associated with plastic use is to recycle. Recycling not only preserves landfill space, but also <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415144004.htm">reduces plastic's carbon footprint</a>. Even if it were more expensive, I am still unsure why it is not being done. We act like pollution doesn't exist and oil is a renewable resource.</p>

<h2>Safety Deposits and Disassembly of Goods: a Tangled mess</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A TV remote with odd buttons, a glittery, single-use birthday sign, spray on insulation, a soda can lined with plastic, carpet glued to fiberglass backing, and a substrate-backed pipette tray—all these things represent man-made products with a limited lifespan, e.g. they're disposable. They also boast a shameless array of plastic, rubber, and vinyl sub-components—all mishmashed and swirled together into a tangled, knotty, <em>non</em>-recyclable <s>whole</s>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these components need to be accounted for. The entire mishmash should be easily taken apart—like pulling a slip knot out of a sewn rice bag, or pressing a quick release on a bicycle tire—we need things to come apart easily so each part can be accounted for, appropriately recovered, redeemed and recycled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently plastic bottles are a great example of a failure here. The bottle itself is recyclable, but the cap and the cap's O-ring (as well as the plastic labeling) are generally considered byproducts to be disposed of or incinerated. Most "recyclable toothbrushes" only focus on the handle itself—which is composed of a homogenized plastic similar to yogurt cups. Very few recycling programs are in place for the tiny nylon bristles. (Note that the only toothbrush with biodegradable bristles <a href="https://gippslandunwrapped.com/2018/06/24/finally-a-toothbrush-with-plant-based-biodegradable-bristles/">lasts but a few uses</a>.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These efforts are not practical until specialized recycling and compositing facilities become more standardized and widely available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The measures needed to fix society's mismanagement of plastic waste are known to scientists, but it is up to governments to implement them—putting bio-plastics in circulation where appropriate, regulating production, and incentivizing consumer recycling. All this should be a matter of subtle political maneuvering, but nothing is being done currently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes our collective complacency is too great for any individual voice to make a difference. So it was with the coronavirus crisis. Critics knew an influenza or SARS outbreak was possible—and suspected it was only a matter of time—but no one could urge governments to take the necessary preparations before the crisis was imminent. Indeed, most countries continued cutting funding to disease programs as the memory of 1918 pandemic grew more distant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><s>I submit to you that we are <em>not</em> stupid, that we make time for what <em>is</em> critically important to us. When this crisis is seen as important to us, we will act accordingly and with clear intention. In spite of all the fine talk nothing will happen til then.</s></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current livelihood of the Western economy depends on the wasteful expenditure of natural capital. Little attention is paid to sustainability (or the needs of men), little respect is paid to Earth. The priority is always getting more money and more power at whatever expense. We must find ways of balancing the strong incentives in capitalism to innovate and produce against the necessary virtue of self-preservation and the need to regulate human activity.</p>
