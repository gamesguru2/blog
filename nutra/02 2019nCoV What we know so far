With a vaccine up to two years away and no way to contain this, it's natural to wonder about its effects, who's vulnerable and how they can potentially protect themselves.


Origin
------

Most closely related to a bat CoV, this branch is unrelated to previous civet, camel and hedgehog variants which were implicated in the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

It appears to have mutated into at least 5 strains, two being the most popular and the most deadly and virulent being the one which affected Wuhan and seems to account for most reported infections.


Lessons from SARS
-----------------

SARS patients at 10-year follow up reported fatigue (50%), muscle and joint pain, shortness of breath, depression, PTSD, and peripheral neuropathy.  It is not known why these effects outside the respiratory system manifest; perhaps it is related to the immune system, cytokines and antibodies.

Other Concerns
--------------

- People likely cannot be re-infected, but can have a longer course of illness. They can also appear to get better; the initial RNA test was only 70% accurate.  The fever only lasts a day, but the respiratory symptoms are much more extensive.
- Dogs, cats canâ€™t pass on coronavirus, but can test positive
- Kids and infants are safest and probably act as asymptomatic vectors
